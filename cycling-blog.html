<h1>A 'bike' guide</h1>
	       
<p>In my previous article, we talked about why you should jump on the bandwagon and get yourself into Mountain Biking. I gave you the highlights as to why to give it a go and now it’s time to move onto what you would need to get into mountain biking.</p>
<p>You might think it’s an expensive hobby with the cost of bikes but in reality you can pick up a pretty cheap bike which is more than capable of getting you out into the wilderness. Check out my simple guide to mountain bikes for beginners.</p>


<h2>The Bike Game</h2>
<h4>The first thing your going to want to get is a mountain bike you can hire these from trail centres or ride a demo day where brands showcase their latest offerings. Although the price you would pay for a two day hire is generally how much you would pay on Gumtree for an entry level bike! Buying a first bike is pretty critical a hard-tail that fits you is always a good start.</h4>

<p class="tip">Tip - If your considering buying your first bike head to a large retailer and try a couple, look online see what you can find often a bike a year out of date is as little as half the price.</p>

<h2>Before You Take The Plunge.</h2>

<p>As i mentioned a demo day is a great way of testing out what bike to buy, but buying a bike is only half the battle. Heading to a coaching day or tester day is a great way to get a feel for biking with a bunch of like minded people. They hold these all over the place, <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">most trail centres</a> will have associated clubs or coaching centres which can provide these. If you want more of a personal touch you can get private coaches to teach the basics or a guide who can show you the routes available out of your doorstep.</p>


<h2>Mountain Bikes for Everyone.</h2>

<h3>Trail Bikes</h3>

<p>The more commonly used Mountain Bikes nowadays are the trail bikes. These tend to have slacker angles for confidence on the descents. This kind of bike generally has front and rear suspension and is more than capable of getting up the hills as down.</p>

<h3>Cross Country Bikes</h3>

<p>These are an extremely lightweight trail bike, generally with front suspension, big wheels and a focus on the climbs and flat sections. Features are targeted more towards climbing prowess and higher speeds on the flatter sections. If you want to cover a lot of ground and make fast ascents, then these bikes are what you are looking for.</p>

<h3>All Mountain / Enduro Bikes</h3>

<p>These bikes are used for more serious adventure mountain biking. The growth of these aggressive full suspension mountain bikes has given birth to the Enduro World Series and is currently the fastest growing discipline in mountain biking. Aside from their light weight and manoeuvrability, they also have stronger frames and more travel in their suspensions that can help you on difficult trails.</p>

<h3>Downhill Bikes</h3>

<p>As the name would suggest, Downhill bikes are for descents only. They are designed for big jumps, rock gardens and mach 10 speeds. These bikes don’t climb but will survive a 15 foot drop. These are where the majority of trends and new tech is generated from as bikes must be built for toughness and durability against the roughest of descents.</p>

<p>You can tell the purpose of this bike just based on its name. These bikes are design for downhill riding. If you love doing high jumps and going downhill then I highly recommend these highly specialised mountain bikes. Although it’s a bit expensive, the materials of these bikes are the best and toughest materials for serious and a bit more dangerous type of mountain biking.</p>

<h3>Fat Bikes</h3>

<p>Basically, they’re the largely oversize bikes with low air pressure. Perfect for adventurous bikers because they give much more grip in sand, snow or other less solid ground. If you want to look a bit different from other bikers then you should get this! :)</p>

<h3>E - Bikes</h3>

<p>The electrical bicycle, also known as an e-bike or booster bike, has an integrated electric motor which can be used for propulsion. These bikes are already available all around the globe with different styles. The great thing about e-bikes is that if you’re tired of pedalling, you can just turn on its power and drive it like a normal motorcycle.</p>
